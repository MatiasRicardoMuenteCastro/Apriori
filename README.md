<h1>Apriori</h1>
<p>The Apriori algorithm aims to make associations and determine which products are frequently bought together. This is done through association rules.
To run the algorithm, a dataset with various products must be provided. The algorithm then analyzes the dataset and finds the product combinations that occur most frequently.</p>

<h2>Practical example of this algorithm</h2>
<p>In a supermarket, it was observed that many customers were buying diapers and beers. Therefore, it was decided to place the beer and diaper shelves next to each other.
After this decision, the sales of both products increased.</p>
<p>This is the idea of the Apriori algorithm, to find combinations that can increase sales, similar to a recommendation system.</p>
